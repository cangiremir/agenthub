Implemented. The repo now has a full AgentHub SaaS stack wired for local/dev and deploy flow, including the required UX/product polish and ops scripts.

Key fixes I added on top of the existing scaffold:
- Push subscription ownership fixed for RLS (`apps/web/src/lib/push.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260217040000_init.sql`).
- Notification click now deep-links to the exact job detail (`apps/web/src/App.tsx`).
- Command history retention capped per agent (last 50) via DB trigger (`supabase/migrations/20260217040000_init.sql`).
- Worker Fly config converted to proper background worker shape (`services/push-worker/fly.toml`).
- Deploy automation now sets Fly secrets, passes Netlify site ID, validates all needed envs, and maps Vite envs (`scripts/deploy.mjs`, `.env.deploy.example`).
- `make dev` / `make deploy` now include dependency install step (`Makefile`).
- Added connector installers (`scripts/install-connector.ps1`, `scripts/install-connector.sh`) and updated docs (`README.md`, `docs/CONNECTOR.md`, `docs/DEPLOY.md`).
- `make dev` now also serves Supabase Edge Functions locally (`scripts/dev.mjs`).

I could not run lint/tests/build in this environment because npm install is blocked by cache/network policy (`ENOTCACHED`), but the repo is set up to run normally on a standard machine.

**1) `make dev` instructions**
```bash
make dev
```
That single command now installs deps, starts Supabase local (best effort), serves edge functions, and runs web + connector + push worker.

**2) Token Checklist**
Everything is ready; to run deploy you only need to provide these tokens in `.env.deploy`:

- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`
- `FLY_API_TOKEN`
- `FLY_APP_NAME`
- `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `VAPID_SUBJECT`

**Where to put them**
- File: `.env.deploy` (copy from `.env.deploy.example`)

**3) `make deploy` command**
```bash
make deploy
```

**4) Connector install one-liners**
PowerShell:
```powershell
npm install; ./scripts/install-connector.ps1
```

macOS/Linux:
```bash
npm install && bash ./scripts/install-connector.sh
```
